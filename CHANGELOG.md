## [1.0.1] - 2026-03-24

### Changed
- Improved Markdown-to-Word table rendering so body columns use content-aware widths instead of near-uniform spacing.
- Inferred table body alignment from the first 2-3 data rows so textual columns stay left-aligned while numeric columns align right.
- Switched cover page and table-of-contents typography to `Malgun Gothic`, including Word-generated `TOC 1` to `TOC 4` styles.

### Fixed
- Reduced unnecessary line wrapping in narrow numeric columns and long descriptive table columns.
- Prevented mixed digit-text codes such as `A-101` from being misclassified as numeric body columns.

### Documentation
- Synced project progress notes in `next_step.md` and `roadmap.md` with the current `main` implementation state.
